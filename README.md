# Free Python Training Drills for Competitive Programmers
MD. AZIZUL HAKIM SOWROV

Welcome! This repository contains a series of focused practice sessions designed to refresh and strengthen your Python skills for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and competitive programming.

## Structure

This repository is organized into several "Pomodoro" sessions, each designed to be a 25-minute focused drill on a specific topic. You can find the code to practice in the `practice.py` file inside each folder.

### üçÖ Pomodoro Sessions

* **Pomo_01_Lists**: Core list operations, slicing, and sorting.
* **Pomo_02_Dictionaries**: Frequency counting and hash map patterns.
* **Pomo_03_Sets**: Uniqueness and fast membership testing.
* **Pomo_04_Superpowers_Pt1**: List comprehensions and basic lambda functions for sorting.
* **Pomo_05_Superpowers_Pt2**: The `collections` module (`deque`, `defaultdict`, `Counter`).
* **Pomo_06_Two_Sum**: Solving a classic interview problem.
* **Pomo_07_Solidify**: Reinforcement and tackling the "Valid Anagram" problem.
* **Pomo_08_Strings_Tuples**: String manipulation and immutable tuples.
* **Pomo_09_Classes**: Building `ListNode` and `TreeNode` for DSA problems.
* **Pomo_10_Recursion**: Understanding the call stack with a base case and recursive step.
* **Pomo_11_Advanced_Sorting**: Multi-level sorting with complex keys.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the project in VS Code.
3.  Create your own virtual environment and install any necessary packages.
